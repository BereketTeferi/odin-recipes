    <h2>Quick dessert that will satisfy any maple-lover's craving.</h2>
    <p>These maple blondies are a quick dessert that will satisfy any maple-lover's craving. 
        You can underbake them slightly for a denser, chewier bar; or bake them until fully 
        set for a cake-style bar.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pure maple syrup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon maple extract</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with 
            enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together melted butter, 1/2 cup maple syrup, brown sugar, egg, 
            1 teaspoon maple extract, and vanilla extract until thoroughly combined. Add in flour, 
            baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into prepared pan and smooth into an even layer. Bake until bars feel just set, 
            15 to 20 minutes. Remove to cool on a wire rack for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the glaze. Whisk together confectioner's sugar, 2 tablespoons maple syrup, 
            heavy cream, 3/4 teaspoon maple extract, and 1/8 teaspoon salt until smooth.</li>
        <li>After bars have cooled for 15 minutes, pour glaze evenly over bars. Allow glaze to set, 
            and bars to cool completely. Cut into 16 bars.</li>
    </ol>
